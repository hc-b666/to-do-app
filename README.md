# MERN Project

i guess i did the incorrectly where i wanted to use all of the topics in one project without understanding

<ul>
  <li>1. typescript</li>
  <li>2. backend</li>
  <li>3. redux rtk</li>
  <li>4. shadcn related thing lol</li>
</ul>

this project should be small actually but its now just big mess / shit 

lol
